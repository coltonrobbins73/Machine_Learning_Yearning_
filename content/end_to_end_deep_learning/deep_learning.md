When faced with a complex problem, a common approach is to divide the task into smaller components that work together in a network. A single component will process some data and pass it to another component. For example, a sentiment analyzer might annotate the nouns and adjectives in a sentence which is then passed to a final classifier. Due to increases in compute scale, an alternative to this model is emerging called end-to-end learning which utilizes a single robust neural network to perform all tasks with one component architecture.

### Benefits and detriments for end-to-end

##### Benefits

1. Intermediate components process and therefore simplify the input data. This inherently means that information is discarded which may be valuable for optimization.
2. Intermediate components summarize the data using frameworks that are intuitive to humans. These summaries might be a poor approximation of reality.

###### Detriments

1. If the intermediate component summarizes the data effectively and isolates key features, much of the system's noise can be ignored.
2. Human intuition can be effective at forming a learning framework for an ML model.

### When is end-to-end favored/disfavored?

If you have a lot of labeled data and compute resources, pure data-driven learning methods can be superior to component-based architecture. The assumption is that a large enough neural network can process and ignore irrelevant data while squeezing out hidden information that might not be intuitively valuable. However, if data are scarce, most of the algorithm's knowledge must be built from human insights.
